# Google Maps Scraper Kit

</p>

A **plug-and-play kit** that runs a free, open-source Google Maps scraper **on your own computer**
and lets **Claude** drive it on autopilot — give Claude a city + a business type, get back a clean
list of businesses (name, address, phone, website, rating, reviews, lat/lng, emails).

Built as a thin wrapper around [**`gosom/google-maps-scraper`**](https://github.com/gosom/google-maps-scraper)
by **Georgios Komninos** (MIT). See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md). This kit adds: a one-command Docker setup,
ready-to-run scripts, and a **Claude skill** so Claude knows exactly how to use the API the right way.

> ⚠️ **Before you scrape — over-use can get your IP temporarily blocked.**
> This runs a real scraper against Google Maps. Light use is fine, but big jobs back-to-back, very high
> `depth`, many keywords, or scheduled runs **without proxies** can make Google **temporarily rate-limit or
> block your IP** (usually clears in minutes–hours; jobs return empty/failed meanwhile). It does **not** ban
> your Google account. Stay safe: **one job at a time, start at `depth 5`, add proxies for large/repeated
> runs.** Scraping Maps is against Google's ToS — use responsibly and follow data law (GDPR/CCPA) for any
> contact data. Full guidance: [Rate limits, bans & responsible use](#️-rate-limits-bans--responsible-use).

## What you get

- 🐳 **One-command local setup** — `docker compose up -d` runs the scraper at `http://localhost:8080`.
- 🤖 **A Claude skill** — open this folder in Claude Code and just say *"scrape coffee shops in Austin"*. Claude does create → poll → download → clean results, following best practices automatically.
- 🛠️ **Standalone scripts** — `scripts/scrape.sh` (bash) and `scripts/scrape.py` (Python, no dependencies) if you'd rather not use Claude.
- 📊 **Google Sheets export (free)** — add `--sheet` and results go straight into your Google Sheet, with duplicates skipped. One-time 3-minute setup, no API key: see [SETUP.md → Export to Google Sheets](SETUP.md#export-to-google-sheets-optional-free).
- 🔒 **Safe by default** — the scraper binds to `127.0.0.1` only, secrets are git-ignored, and the skill enforces rate-limit / legal / data-handling guardrails.

## What it scrapes (and what it doesn't)

- ✅ **Google Maps business listings** → a clean **lead list** by default: `name, phone, email, website, category, address, rating, review count`. The scraper captures ~34 raw fields, but the kit **strips the noise** (geo coordinates, IDs, hours, images, review blobs) so you only get data you can actually use for outreach. Want everything? `scrape.py --full`.
- ➕ **Optional socials** (`--socials`): also pulls each business's **Instagram / Facebook / LinkedIn** by scanning its website. **Token cost: 0** — it runs in code (HTTP + regex), no AI. It only adds ~40–50 tokens *per business* if you later load the rows into an AI chat (≈+2k for 50 leads; nothing if you keep the file on disk). It's slower (one fetch per site) and coverage is partial (only businesses that link socials on their site).
- ❌ **Not** a social-media scraper. It cannot touch Instagram / TikTok / YouTube.

## Why use this instead of asking an AI to "just scrape Google Maps"

Tested head-to-head: a chat AI fetching `maps.google.com` directly hits a **consent wall** and
**JavaScript-rendered** content, so it returns **~0 structured results**. This kit reliably returns
**dozens–hundreds of clean rows per query**. For Google Maps, it's the difference between *can't* and *can*.

## Quick start (3 steps)

```bash
# 1. Start the scraper (needs Docker Desktop)
docker compose up -d

# 2. Check it's alive — should print a JSON list (probably empty [])
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs

# 3a. Scrape with the script…
./scripts/scrape.sh "coffee shops in Austin TX" 30.2672 -97.7431 5

# 3b. …or open this folder in Claude Code and say:
#     "Scrape gyms in Miami and give me phones + websites."
```

## Invoking it in Claude Code

### Slash commands
| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/scrape <business> in <city, ST> [depth]` | Run a scrape and get a clean table |
| `/scrape-batch <keywords-file> [--city "City, ST"]` | Scrape many queries in one job |
| `/scrape-setup` | Start the local scraper + health check |
| `/scrape-jobs [list \| delete <id>]` | List or delete jobs |

Example: `/scrape dentists in Denver CO 10`

### Or just talk to it — the skill auto-triggers on phrases like:
- "scrape coffee shops in Austin"
- "find all gyms in Miami with phone numbers"
- "build me a lead list of dentists in Denver, CO"
- "pull Google Maps listings for plumbers in Phoenix"

It intentionally **does not** trigger for social media (Instagram/TikTok) — that's not what it does.

## ⚠️ Rate limits, bans & responsible use

The upstream project's guidance (and ours): *"Please use this scraper responsibly and in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized scraping may violate terms of service."* There's **no
published ban threshold**, so be conservative.

**What "over-use" looks like** and the risk:
- Big jobs back-to-back, very high `depth`, many keywords at once, or scheduled runs **without proxies**.
- Risk: Google **temporarily rate-limits/blocks your IP** (minutes–hours, then clears). Your Google
  **account is not banned**. While blocked, jobs come back `failed` or with empty/short results.

**Block signals to watch:** jobs returning `failed`, suddenly empty results, or far fewer rows than an
identical earlier run. If you see these, **slow down** — pause, lower `depth`, or add proxies.

**Stay safe:**
- One job at a time; start at `depth 5` and raise only as needed.
- Turn on `email` extraction only when you need emails (it's much slower).
- Treat results as **leads to verify**, not a redistributable dataset. Don't resell raw Google data.
- Scraped phones/emails are **personal data** → follow GDPR/CCPA/CAN-SPAM if you store or contact them.

**When to add proxies** (*"For larger scraping jobs, proxies help avoid rate limiting"*): large jobs, many
keywords, repeated/scheduled runs, or after you hit block signals. Set the `proxies` array in the job body:
```json
"proxies": ["socks5://user:pass@host:port", "http://host2:port2"]
```
Types: `socks5`, `socks5h`, `http`, `https` (auth optional). The scraper rotates them automatically.
For reference, upstream measures ~120 places/min at `-c 8 -depth 1`.

> Claude's rule here is **warn, don't block**: if you ask for a large scrape, it'll flag the risk and
> suggest proxies, then run it anyway. It only refuses clearly abusive use.
